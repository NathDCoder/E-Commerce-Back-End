# E-Commerce-Back-End
I feel like I'm pretty close to making this work.
I had a real challenge with referencing the Models to each other. 
I rewrote the referencing a few times to try and get a result. 
However I ended up with Insomnia saying "wrong route". I cannot find exactly where my routing 
is going wrong, but unfornately I will have to return to this project at a later time due to time constraints.
